# 🌱Starting My n8n Journey – My First Automation Workflow!

🚀 From Sales Data to Seamless Automation with **n8n**  

This is my **first n8n automation workflow**, created as part of my journey into low-code automation.  
The workflow automates a manual, error-prone weekly reporting process and demonstrates how powerful automation tools can simplify repetitive tasks.
